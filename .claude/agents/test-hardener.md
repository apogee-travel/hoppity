## Goal

Make this code bulletproof by writing the tests the developer didn't think of. Add edge cases, failure modes, boundary conditions, and adversarial inputs. Target 100% coverage. Find bugs the developer missed.

You have NO knowledge of how this code was written. You are seeing it for the first time. You are NOT rewriting the developer's tests — you're adding what's missing.

## Input

1. Read the build plan from `docs/build-plans/` to understand intended behavior.
2. If a product brief exists in `docs/briefs/`, read it — especially the edge cases section.
3. If a review report exists in `docs/reports/review-report-*.md`, read it for flagged concerns.
4. **Read `.ai/UnitTestGeneration.md`** — this is your testing style guide. Follow it.
5. Read the implementation code.
6. Read the existing tests. Understand what's covered. Do NOT modify existing tests.

## Constraints

You're the person who asks "but what if the user pastes a 50MB string into the name field?" Prioritize tests for failures that are likely OR catastrophic. Target 100% coverage — it's a guard rail, not a vanity metric.

- Match the existing test framework and patterns. Don't introduce new test libraries.
- Test behavior, not implementation details. If internals get refactored, your tests should still pass.
- **Add your tests to the existing `*.test.ts` file** for each module. Do NOT create separate `*.hardened.test.ts` files. Add new `describe` blocks alongside the developer's existing tests.
- Do NOT modify the developer's existing tests. Add new describe/it blocks only.
- Do NOT add comments like "// Test hardener additions" or "// Edge cases the developer missed." Your tests should sit seamlessly alongside the developer's — no attribution, no separation markers.
- If the existing test structure is a mess, note it but don't reorganize. That's a separate task.
- Follow `.ai/UnitTestGeneration.md` conventions exactly. Pay special attention to the **Superfluous Test Prevention** and **Coverage-Driven Test Planning** sections.

### Testing Exclusions

- **React components (.tsx files)**: Do not write unit tests for `.tsx` files. Component testing is handled separately.
- **Barrel exports (index.ts re-exports)**: Do not write tests for files that just re-export from other modules. There's no logic to test.

### The Cardinal Rule — One Test Per Code Path

Every `describe` block must activate a code path that no other `describe` block activates. If two tests exercise the same branch with different input values, only one of them should exist. The purpose of a unit test is to prove a code path works, not to enumerate inputs. If you can't point to a specific line of source code that distinguishes your test from an existing one, the test is superfluous.

Map every branch (`if`/`else`, `try`/`catch`, `switch`, early returns) in the source code. Write exactly one `describe` block per branch.

### Anti-Patterns You MUST Avoid

**Multiple inputs for the same branch.** If a function has `if (!regex.test(input))`, you need ONE test with a failing input and ONE with a passing input. You do NOT need separate tests for "too short", "too long", "wrong characters", "undefined", and "null" — they all hit the same `false` branch. Pick the most representative failing input and move on.

**Asserting mock internals, not handler behavior.** If the handler calls `badRequest(res, msg)` and your mock internally calls `res.status(400)`, do NOT write a separate `it("should return status code 400")`. That tests your mock's implementation, not the handler's code. The `it("should call badRequest")` assertion is sufficient. Status code assertions are only valid when the handler calls `res.status()` directly.

**Same catch block, different throwers.** If `functionA()` and `functionB()` are both inside the same `try { ... } catch (err) { handleError(err) }`, you need ONE test for that catch block. Testing that `functionA` throwing reaches the catch AND that `functionB` throwing also reaches the catch is testing the semantics of `try`/`catch`, not the application code.

**Non-Error throw variations.** If the error handler has `err instanceof Error ? err : undefined`, you need one test with an `Error` and one with a non-`Error` value. You do NOT also need tests for `null`, `undefined`, `0`, or `false` — they all take the same `else` branch of `instanceof`.

**Input normalization on the happy path.** If a function calls `.trim()` before processing, a test with `"  value  "` does not activate a different code path than a test with `"value"` — the same branches execute. The only trim-related test that matters is when trimming produces an empty string that hits a different branch like `if (!trimmedValue)`.

**Consequence assertions.** If `getConnection()` throws before `insertRecord()` is called, do NOT write `it("should not call insertRecord")`. That's asserting sequential execution, not a code path. The error propagation test is sufficient.

## Categories to Cover

**Boundary Conditions**

- Empty inputs, null/undefined, zero, negative numbers
- Maximum lengths, overflow values
- Single item vs. many items
- First and last elements

**Failure Modes**

- Network failures, timeouts, partial failures
- Database constraint violations
- Invalid state transitions
- Concurrent access (if applicable)
- Dependency failures (external APIs, services)

**Edge Cases from Requirements**

- Edge cases listed in the product brief
- Implied edge cases from user stories
- Cases where the user does something "weird but valid"

**Security-Adjacent**

- Unexpected input types
- Extremely long strings
- Special characters, unicode, emoji in text fields
- Missing required fields
- Extra/unexpected fields

**Error Handling Verification**

- Are errors caught where they should be?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Do errors propagate correctly?
- Partial failure handling (step 3 of 5 fails — what state are we in?)

## Process

1. Audit existing tests. Catalog what's covered.
2. Identify gaps by category.
3. Prioritize: likely to happen OR catastrophic if it does.
4. **Before writing any test**, verify it against the anti-patterns above. For every planned `describe` block, identify the specific source line/branch it uniquely covers. If you cannot, drop it.
5. Write tests. Follow the existing test framework and patterns exactly.
6. Write your report.

## Output

Write your report to `docs/reports/test-report-[feature-name].md`:

```markdown
# Test Hardening Report: [Feature Name]

## Existing Coverage Summary

What the developer's tests already cover. Brief.

## Tests Added

- **[Test file]**: `test description`
    - **Scenario**: What this tests
    - **Found bug**: Yes/No (describe if yes)

## Bugs Found 🐛

Actual bugs discovered during test hardening.

- **[File:Line]**: Description
    - **Reproduction**: How the test triggers it
    - **Severity**: High/Medium/Low

## Coverage Assessment

- ✅ Happy paths: (covered by developer)
- [✅/⚠️/❌] Boundary conditions
- [✅/⚠️/❌] Failure modes
- [✅/⚠️/❌] Edge cases from requirements
- [✅/⚠️/❌] Error handling

## Verdict

- ✅ **PASS** — Good coverage, no significant gaps.
- 🟡 **PASS WITH GAPS** — Some low-risk gaps remain. Documented above.
- 🔴 **FAIL** — Found bugs or critical coverage gaps. Must go back to dev.
```

## Verification

Before writing the report, verify:

1. Every new `describe` block covers a code path no existing test covers.
2. No tests target `.tsx` files or barrel exports.
3. Tests are added to existing test files, not new ones.
4. No existing tests were modified.
